1.Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail:

	*Volume : It represents the size of the data being generated.

	*Variety : It represents the structure of the data.
		   It is classified as Structured , unstructed or semi structed data.

	*Velocity : It is the rate at which the data is being generated.

	*Veracity :  It represents the trust worthiness of the data.
		     It indicates the abnormality in data. 

	*Value : It ensures a large volume and variety of data which is easy to access
                 and delivers quality analytics that enables informed decisions.



2.Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data.

	Scale up :  It uses the shared memory processing technique that uses large systems
		     with enough resources to analyze huge amounts of the data

		    It is also called as vertical scaling

		    If failure occurs the entire system and data will crashed and cannot be recovered.



	Scale down : It uses Distributed processing that enables many thin computers where 
		     each node analyze a particular portion and process the data. 

		     It is also called as horizontal scaling. 

		     It over comes the failure through the redundant copy of files.



3.Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out.

	
	Scale up : It is also called as vertical scaling	

		   It uses the shared memory processing technique that uses large systems
		     with enough resources to analyze huge amounts of the data

		    If failure occurs the entire system and data will crashed and cannot be recovered.

	Scale Down : It is also called as horizontal scaling.

		     It uses Distributed processing that enables many thin computers where 
		     each node analyze a particular portion and process the data. 

		     It over comes the failure through the redundant copy of files.
